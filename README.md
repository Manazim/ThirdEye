# Overview

## Reminder: User refer to the blind people. The dashboard user refer to the family of the blind people.

This is an IOT project that I have develop for my FYP. The integration of Machine Learning and IOT, the system is primarily targeting blind people in helping them identify the hazard such as Sharp Object and Hot Object. Not stop till there this project was exetended it capability by giving realtime alert to the user(blind people) through vibrator and human voice. Also the alert will directly send to the family of the user in the Telegram group chat through Telegram bot. The alert message consist of the current location of the user(the blind people) and also the snap of image(incase the gps sensor not orking). Powering Raspi4 and enhancing with GPU coral TPU accelerator, this has facing almost 0 lag during testing and the framrate show a convincong number. Furthermore this system aslp atatched with the health monitoring sensor for sense oxygen level and heart beat of the user.

# Hardware Requiremnets:
